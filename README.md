# RHAL - for blue pill

RHAL is a collection of  C++ functions that lets you control the stm32f103c8 chip.

## Description üìã

RHAL's main objective is to serve as a base platform for robotics development that needs too be simple but efficient.
Supported functionalities are:

- GPIO
  - inputs with pullup and pulldown
  - outputs with pushpull and opendrain modes
- Hardware timers
  - Timers interrupts
  - PWM
  - Encoder interface
- Software timers
- ADC
- External interrupts (pending)
- Hardware encoder implementation (pending)

## Getting started üöÄÔ∏è

### Dependencies

RHAL is based on the CMSIS framework. We recomend the usage of "Platform.io", but you can use any IDE that supports this framework

### Installation

- **PlatformIO**
  - you can directly download the library from platformio's library manager.
- **Direct download**
  - In case you decide to install it manualy, you can download and extract this project in any folder and the install it runing `pio lib install C:\your-path` in a PIO terminal

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

Once you have RHAL installed in your project, proceed to create a *main.cpp* file like the follownig.

```c++
#include <RHAL.h> //this includes the hole library

void main(){
    RHAL Rhal; //<!> needed for initialization
  
    while(1){
      /*
        updates system flags. 
        And optional function pointer con be passed for execution every 1 ms
      */
      Rhal.tick();
    }
}
```

**there are examples for the different modules in the [examples](https://github.com/SqLemon/RHAL/tree/main/examples) folder.**
